              <p>This project is ongoing. I have posted some of my code to my GitHub (<a href="https://www.github.com/ppublicgit/Finance">finance repository</a>).
                 The code is all first version tests of what I want to implement. Due to the nature of stock trading, I have not shared all my code, ideas or final versions,
                 only the early versions codes and the simple concept ideas, mainly for back-testing purposes.</p>
              <p>I find the stock market an intriguing system
              of global interaction. Many common mathematics and even physics processes
              surprisngly show up in financial markets. One of the most important and famous of these patterns
              is the price of stocks. Louis Bachelier, a French mathematician, is credited with the discovery of the
              brownian motion of stock prices in his Ph.D. dissertation, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Bachelier">"The Theory of Speculation"</a>.
              The book by Burton Malkiel, "A Random Walk Down Wall Street", brought this revelation and theory to the public. Nowadays,
              with the advent of faster and faster computers and simple, easy to use programming languages, the popularity of quantitative trading has taken off.
              Things such as high-frequency trading and statistical arbitrage have become common practices for hedge funds and day traders. Furthermore, large data
              facilitates traders in formulating trading ideas and back-testing their performance against historical data.</p>
              <p>I decided to dip my feet into quantitative trading to learn more about the subject and to
              practice my Python and math skills. I read several books, including my favorite, by E.P. Chan, "Algorithmic Trading," to learn more on the
              topic and improve my understanding of the field. Following this guide, as well as posts on various blogs and forums, I created my own
              tools for trading and finding edges in the market. Among these tools, I have a webscraper for Yahoo Finance key statistics, Twitter and
              Stocktwit that collects data via an input of stock symbol and returns a pandas dataframe of important information. I also have various tests for
              cointegration (Hurst exponent, ADF, Johansen and Variance Ratio) and an asset allocation optimizer (Kelly formula) given stock symbols as well. </p>

              Blackjack Card Counting Simulation

              <p>Beating the house by card counting and winning millions in a single night of blackjack is an
              exciting dream. How feasible is this scheme really? Programming allows you to simulate and solve the question once and for all.</p>
              <p>I had not used Python's class structure before and thought it would be a great way to get
              practice with object orientated programming (OOP). The code I created is a little rough, as it was my first
              ever attempt at OOP in Pytohn, but while it is not pretty, it gets the job done. I developed Python code to
              simulate multiple hands of blackjack to see if counting cards was an effective and reliable means of making money.
              I used oop to create classes for cards, hands, decks and a game of blackjack as well. The user can call on the blackjack
              class and set the rules for the game. This includes if the dealer hits on a soft 17, how many decks the dealer uses, the blackjack
              payout rate and more. The code then uses the strategy tables that fit with the rules chosen by the user, and simulates whatever
              number of hands the user specifies. The code and some simple statistical analysis of a few simulations can be found on my
              github (<a href="https://www.github.com/ppublicgit/Card-Games">Blackjack Simulation Repository</a>)</p>
              <p>What I found was that the margins for error in card counting are incredibly slim. First, the blackjack payout mus be strong,
              too small and the house always can expect to win. Another key rule is the depth of penetration into the deck (this is the point
              at which the dealer reshuffles all the cards, resetting the count). For the card counter to expect to win money, he/she needs a large
              amount of capital (as a serious drawdown period must be survivable, as well as enough money to place large bets when the count is in the
              players favor) and must never make a mistake on strategy or the count. To make matters worse, most casinos these days have
              an eye-in-the-sky watching all players and looking for counters. To hide that one is counting cards,
              one must occasionally bet against the count to better avoid detection. The prospects of winning money via
              card counting is nigh on impossible. Even if one plays perfectly, the winnings are still quite slim. The best method, and in my
              humble opinion the only real method, to winning lots of money counting cards requires a team of counters. The team could have several people
              sit at tables and bet small the whole time to get a count of the table, and then signal to a teammate to come into the table whenever the count
              is strongly in the player's favor. That way, the player can bet big and often early in the game, without having to absorb the losses while trying to establish
              and time the count. This brings in more risk of being caught, and the winnings are split among a larger group. In the end, there are probably
              easier means to obtain financial wealth than the high risk environment of card counting and casino blackjack.</p>

      <h3>Sandia National Laboratories (SNL)</h3>
      <div class="container">
        <p>I had two major stints at Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore, CA: as an inern following the completion
          of my BS in Physics from Arizona State University (ASU) and then as a private contractor to continue my work and research after an extended trip abroad. As an
        intern, I was tasked with creating a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in MATLAB for
        test equipment and collecting data. I spent several months designing the GUI and setting up the
        various protocols used for communicating with all the instruments in the research lab. The goal of the project
        was to create a solenoid pressure system to simulate an engine's cycle to extend and further the research
        being done in the lab into nozzle spray characteristics. By the end of the internship I had completed
        a working GUI that had full, automated control with all the experimental instruments and the initial
        visualization of each run's data that was saved for further analysis. The instrument communication was built primarily on
        object-oriented-programming, allowing future users an easy means for updating and upgrading the communications.
        Links to a PDF for the internship research paper and poster are provided below.</p>
        <p>As a private contractor, I was tasked with creating a GUI in LabVIEW for a different
        experiment, as well as updating the MATLAB GUI I had previously designed. I added several new features to the MATLAB
        GUI to improve its efficiency and user satisfaction. I also spent time training my coworkers how to code
        in MATLAB and in GUI control and maintenance. The LabVIEW GUI was trickier than the MATLAB GUI as it had multiple
        data collection speeds and times of interest and required precise timing and synchronization between high and low speed data
        acquisition units. Eventually, I was able to implement an advanced system with precise digital triggering timing to
        synchronize all data acquistion. I also trained fellow lab workers in LabVIEW to facilitate ease of use and understanding for
        the GUI</p>
        <p>Lastly, I collected data using my MATLAB GUI in different pressure system environments to research the effects of
          a variable pressure on nozzle spray characteristics. Data was collected for the pressure of the system, as well as high-speed
          imaging of the bubble characteristics inside an injector nozzle in order to investigate performance. I generated code in MATLAB
          to perform high-speed image processing and recognition to determine how the bubbles in the nozzle were affected by the pressure
          cycling in the system. I then visualized the data in MATLAB and authored a paper on the topic with the assistance of my principal
          investigator/supervisor and colleagues. The paper is currently pending publication.

      <h3>Arizona State University (ASU)</h3>
      <div class="container">
        <p>During my junior and senior years at Arizona State University, I worked as an undergraduate
        research assistant in an astrophysics lab. The position doubled as a job and a class and
        allowed me to complete my honor's thesis (required for graduation from Barrett the Honor's College at ASU).
        I worked on the design, construction and testing of a low temperature (~2.5K) cryostat. It was similar to
        work I completed at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, but this time I was able to test and characterize the noise
        of microwave kinetic inductance inductors(MKIDs). My honor's thesis focused on the analysis of the MKIDs noise
        data. I used Python to automate the data collection from the MKIDs. The MKIDs were brought down to a temperature of
        2.9K and then a vector network analyzer (VNA) was used to send signals to the MKIDs and to record their responses.
        Optical fiber was run from the VNA outside the vessel to the MKID inside to limit thermal heating from conduction, as
        copper wiring would have heated the MKIDs to much higher than 2.9K. The collected data was analyzed in Python using various
        mathematics and physics techniques and equations to characterize the noise of the MKIDs. The results of the research and
        the thesis can be viewed in the link's below.</p>

      <h3>Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL)</h3>
      <div class="container">
        <p>After my junior year in college I spent my summer as a research intern at LBNL in Berkeley, CA.
          My work focused on the design and construction of a cryostat (low temperature, low pressure vessel
          used to test superconducting detectors). I was tasked with designing and constructing the milliKelvin stage
          used as a testbed for research and development of detectors to observe microwave radiation from space. My work
          mainly consisted of three different areas. The first was CAD modeling. I used SolidWorks and other tools to design
          various parts for the system and to create the engineering drawings sent to machinists to create parts. I also was a part
          of the review process for quality control of incoming and outgoing drawings and parts. Phase two of my research was constructing the apparatus itself.
          This consisted of installing the parts upon arrival and researching the proper materials and equipment needed for experimental setup and data collection.
          The last portion of the research was testing the vessel. Not all the parts were able to be added by the time I completed the internship due to long lead times
          of some parts, but I was able to successfully test the performance of what had arrived. I created code in Python to communicate with
          an assortment of sensors and detectors to automate the data collection and subsequently used code in Python to analyze the outputs. The vessel passed
          all tests.<p>

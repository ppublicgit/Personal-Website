                                      CS 637 had several homework projects. My github has a repository for the
                                      work performed in completing the homework assignments.
                                      <a href="https://github.com/ppublicgit/CS637">https://github.com/ppublicgit/CS637</a>
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                      The first project was to write
                                      our own back propagating neural network. The network had to be able
                                      to accept different activation functions, shapes and cost functions
                                      at initialization. The code can be viewed on the github link under HW1.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                      The second project was to use pytorch to classify the CIFAR 10 image
                                      dataset. The code and results can be viewed in the github link
                                      under HW2.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                      The third project was open ended. I chose to create a recurrent neural network (rnn)
                                      to learn to write Shakespeare. In my first attempt I hand coded a vanilla rnn. Its
                                      performance was fairly weak, though not surprising. The vanilla rnn has no 'memory'
                                      and so it fails to properly write Shakespeare. It is unaware of any character that is
                                      not immediately preceeding it so the text is jumbled. I then used pytorch to create
                                      a multilayer long short term memory (LSTM) network for the problem. After some
                                      training, the output is fairly believable. The text is formatted correctly and reads
                                      like a screenplay. Sentence structure is evident and proper headers for each
                                      actor is present. The only deficiency is the story does not make sense. Each character's
                                      dialogue does not match nor respond in kind to each other's dialogue. This is not surprising
                                      as the network learning semantic meaning is a much more difficult task that would require a
                                      larger network, more training and more training data.

                                      The first project for CS 687 required us to create our own, miniature database and implement
                                      a simple GUI to interact with it. The requirements were to write a sql script to generate the database
                                      and a GUI to then interact with the database. The code I made to support this project is found on my github.

                                      CS 588 had several projects I completed over the course of the semester. The third homwework assignment
                                      was to perform exploratory data analysis on several datasets. The work can be found on github. In particular
                                      1.ipynb. <a href="https://github.com/ppublicgit/CS588-HW3">https://github.com/ppublicgit/CS588-HW3</a>

                                      The second homework assignment was to use several different clustering techniques on the famous
                                      indian and iris datasets. The results are on github. The bulk of the work can be seen the file HW4.ipynb.

                                      The last project was more free form. We had to pick any topic of interest and apply big data practices towards the
                                      topic. I chose to look into basketball data to see if it was possible to predict game outcomes based on a teams'
                                      averages over the season.

                                      Like many other classes there were several projects during the semester. CS 641 focused on data mining.
                                      The second homework was a task to classify areas of land as either rainfed or irrigated. In the end I used
                                      a random forest to perform the task. The files are found in the folder homework 2 and the main report is
                                      in the file model.ipynb.

                                      The second project was to determine cancerous from non cancerous images. In the end I used principal component analysis,
                                      along with an SVM learner to classify the data. The dataset was also unbalanced, thus
                                      I used a different class weighting to improve the f-score of the data instead of merely focusing on accuracy.

                  <div class="container">
                      <p>I had two major stints at Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore, CA: as an inern following the completion
                          of my BS in Physics from Arizona State University (ASU) and then as a private contractor to continue my work and research after an extended trip abroad. As an
                          intern, I was tasked with creating a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in MATLAB for
                          test equipment and collecting data. I spent several months designing the GUI and setting up the
                          various protocols used for communicating with all the instruments in the research lab. The goal of the project
                          was to create a solenoid pressure system to simulate an engine's cycle to extend and further the research
                          being done in the lab into nozzle spray characteristics. By the end of the internship I had completed
                          a working GUI that had full, automated control with all the experimental instruments and the initial
                          visualization of each run's data that was saved for further analysis. The instrument communication was built primarily on
                          object-oriented-programming, allowing future users an easy means for updating and upgrading the communications.
                          Links to a PDF for the internship research paper and poster are provided below.</p>
                      <p>As a private contractor, I was tasked with creating a GUI in LabVIEW for a different
                          experiment, as well as updating the MATLAB GUI I had previously designed. I added several new features to the MATLAB
                          GUI to improve its efficiency and user satisfaction. I also spent time training my coworkers how to code
                          in MATLAB and in GUI control and maintenance. The LabVIEW GUI was trickier than the MATLAB GUI as it had multiple
                          data collection speeds and times of interest and required precise timing and synchronization between high and low speed data
                          acquisition units. Eventually, I was able to implement an advanced system with precise digital triggering timing to
                          synchronize all data acquistion. I also trained fellow lab workers in LabVIEW to facilitate ease of use and understanding for
                          the GUI</p>
                      <p>Lastly, I collected data using my MATLAB GUI in different pressure system environments to research the effects of
                          a variable pressure on nozzle spray characteristics. Data was collected for the pressure of the system, as well as high-speed
                          imaging of the bubble characteristics inside an injector nozzle in order to investigate performance. I generated code in MATLAB
                          to perform high-speed image processing and recognition to determine how the bubbles in the nozzle were affected by the pressure
                          cycling in the system. I then visualized the data in MATLAB and authored a paper on the topic with the assistance of my principal
                          investigator/supervisor and colleagues. The paper is currently pending publication.

                      <p>During my junior and senior years at Arizona State University, I worked as an undergraduate
                          research assistant in an astrophysics lab. The position doubled as a job and a class and
                          allowed me to complete my honor's thesis (required for graduation from Barrett the Honor's College at ASU).
                          I worked on the design, construction and testing of a low temperature (~2.5K) cryostat. It was similar to
                          work I completed at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, but this time I was able to test and characterize the noise
                          of microwave kinetic inductance inductors(MKIDs). My honor's thesis focused on the analysis of the MKIDs noise
                          data. I used Python to automate the data collection from the MKIDs. The MKIDs were brought down to a temperature of
                          2.9K and then a vector network analyzer (VNA) was used to send signals to the MKIDs and to record their responses.
                          Optical fiber was run from the VNA outside the vessel to the MKID inside to limit thermal heating from conduction, as
                          copper wiring would have heated the MKIDs to much higher than 2.9K. The collected data was analyzed in Python using various
                          mathematics and physics techniques and equations to characterize the noise of the MKIDs. The results of the research and
                          the thesis can be viewed in the link's below.</p>

                      <p>After my junior year in college I spent my summer as a research intern at LBNL in Berkeley, CA.
                          My work focused on the design and construction of a cryostat (low temperature, low pressure vessel
                          used to test superconducting detectors). I was tasked with designing and constructing the milliKelvin stage
                          used as a testbed for research and development of detectors to observe microwave radiation from space. My work
                          mainly consisted of three different areas. The first was CAD modeling. I used SolidWorks and other tools to design
                          various parts for the system and to create the engineering drawings sent to machinists to create parts. I also was a part
                          of the review process for quality control of incoming and outgoing drawings and parts. Phase two of my research was constructing the apparatus itself.
                          This consisted of installing the parts upon arrival and researching the proper materials and equipment needed for experimental setup and data collection.
                          The last portion of the research was testing the vessel. Not all the parts were able to be added by the time I completed the internship due to long lead times
                          of some parts, but I was able to successfully test the performance of what had arrived. I created code in Python to communicate with
                          an assortment of sensors and detectors to automate the data collection and subsequently used code in Python to analyze the outputs. The vessel passed
                          all tests.<p>

                                      I designed this website from scratch after reading through some online tutorial, texts,
                                      stack overflow and looking at other websites for inspiration. I am quite pleased with
                                      how it all turned out. Not bad for my first ever HTML/CSS project. And it only took a couple
                                      weeks from no experience to boot. You can find all my code for this website on my github page

                                      Prior to starting my masters program at UAH, I read and worked through a Stephen Marsland's Machine Learning book.
                                      I wrote my own takes on several classic machine learning techniques, including svm, random forests, decision trees
                                      and a multi layer perceptron. At the time I was also reading a fair amount on functional programming
                                      and so I tried to write all the code functionally. The code is found on my github. The learning algorithms
                                      are found in the Learners folder and the programs to run and test my algorithms are within the various
                                      python files at the root directory.

                                      A friend and coworker showed me the Haskell programming language. He also suggested reading the book
                                      Haskell from First Principles by Chris Allen. I worked through much of the book, played with the
                                      language and found I really enjoy it. The purity of its functional programming principles present a new
                                      approach and challenge to writing code. The lack of traditional imperative paradigms such as loops and
                                      objects at first was difficult to grasp. However, afterwhile I grew to appreciate the beauty and ingenuity
                                      of recursion. I particularly liked the built in support of list comprehension, functors, applicatives and
                                      more.

                                      I decided to practice my skills with the language I wrote a terminal chess game. The code is on my github.
                                      I learned a lot during the exercise and grew to truly appreciate Haskell by the time I finished. I do not
                                      agree with all the decisions I made for the code, but in the end I was happy with the product.

                                      a textbook a friend lent me on the subject. It covered all sorts of structures from arrays,
                                      to linked lists, to hash tables, to general trees and more. I wrote all the data structures
                                      in C++.

                                      The code is all first version tests of what I want to implement. Due to the nature of stock trading, I have not shared all my code, ideas or final versions,
                                      only the early versions codes and the simple concept ideas, mainly for back-testing purposes.</p>
                                  <p>I find the stock market an intriguing system
                                      of global interaction. Many common mathematics and even physics processes
                                      surprisngly show up in financial markets. One of the most important and famous of these patterns
                                      is the price of stocks. Louis Bachelier, a French mathematician, is credited with the discovery of the
                                      brownian motion of stock prices in his Ph.D. dissertation, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Bachelier">"The Theory of Speculation"</a>.
                                      The book by Burton Malkiel, "A Random Walk Down Wall Street", brought this revelation and theory to the public. Nowadays,
                                      with the advent of faster and faster computers and simple, easy to use programming languages, the popularity of quantitative trading has taken off.
                                      Things such as high-frequency trading and statistical arbitrage have become common practices for hedge funds and day traders. Furthermore, large data
                                      facilitates traders in formulating trading ideas and back-testing their performance against historical data.</p>
                                  <p>I decided to dip my feet into quantitative trading to learn more about the subject and to
                                      practice my Python and math skills. I read several books, including my favorite, by E.P. Chan, "Algorithmic Trading," to learn more on the
                                      topic and improve my understanding of the field. Following this guide, as well as posts on various blogs and forums, I created my own
                                      tools for trading and finding edges in the market. Among these tools, I have a webscraper for Yahoo Finance key statistics, Twitter and
                                      Stocktwit that collects data via an input of stock symbol and returns a pandas dataframe of important information. I also have various tests for
                                      cointegration (Hurst exponent, ADF, Johansen and Variance Ratio) and an asset allocation optimizer (Kelly formula) given stock symbols as well. </p>

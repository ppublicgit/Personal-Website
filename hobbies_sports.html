          <p><strong>Golf:</strong> As Mark Twain once said, "Golf is a good walk spoiled", and he
          could not have been more correct. Golf is a perfect way to ruin a beautiful sunday
          morning with disappointment, frustration and seething rage. Somehow though,
          it constantly draws people back for more. Golf requires intense focus, precise
          movements and a calm composure in order to succeed. One of my favorite aspects
          of golf is that anybody, at any time, can hit a shot that even a professional
          would be jealous of. Everyone has the potential for greatness on any given shot,
          the difference is truly great golfers just make less mistakes. It is an unforgiving
          sport that offers extreme highs and lows.</p>

        <p>Uhhhh, grehhhh. Those are the most common sounds you will hear out of me while
        I am <strong>Rock Climbing</strong>. Each move somehow seems to elicit another grunt
        of exertion out of me as I pull myself higher and higher up the cliff face. Rock climbing
        is a great mix of endurance, power and mental toughness. Being suspended, or for the truly
        daring, not suspended, many feet above the hard ground is a thrilling experience. There is
        a small part in the back of your mind questioning the structural integrity of your rope and
        equipment. The secret to climbing is to just not fall! Unfortunately, that level of skill is
        reserved for mountain goats and Alex Honnold. For me, rock climbing is a great means of exercise
        as well as a meditatitve experience as it allows me to clear my head and focus on a simple task. One foot,
        one hand in front of the other.</p>

          <p><strong>Skiing:</strong> The strongest reason to cheer for winter and snow.
          For some reason, I have always been drawn to snowcapped mountains and snow covered
          trees. There is something incredibly beautiful about the white blanket of snow that
          masks hillsides and mountain slopes. Skiing is great for a number of reasons, one of
          which is that falling into snow does not particularly hurt! It is not often that you
          can barrell down at 20 mph, fall aggressively and pop up laughing. I started skiing
          after I turned twenty-one and I wish I could have started sooner. Either way, yearly
          trips to the mountain to "shred some powder" will forever be on my list of things to
          do come winter season.</p>

          <p><strong>Scuba Diving:</strong> To be completely honest, I do not consider
          scuba diving a sport, but I am including it anyways. My first descent
          into the deep was a little unsettling at first, but since then it has been nothing
          but fun. I have always wanted to travel to space and other planets since I was kid.
          Being an astronaut was a dream of mine. In college, my professor was an astronaut. He said
          something poetic that has always stuck with me, "Scuba diving is the closest most people can
          ever get to space, aliens or other worlds". He was right. Scuba diving is a great experience, visiting a world not of humans, but of fish. Everything
          about the underwater world is different. I have seen many different species of fish while diving. Some
          of my favorites include octopuses, cuttlefish, rays, eels and any and all bioluminescent fish. I have also
          had the chance to do a wreck dive of a sunken warship, which was a strange and enthralling adventure.
          Seeing the ocean consume a once powerful military vessel was a once in a lifetime experience. The cold, dark and
          empty halls and rooms were haunting, made worse by the occasional large, shadowed fish swimming
          in and out of view. </p>
          <p><strong>Flying:</strong> Now this is definitely not a sport but it is a great pasttime.
              I currently have a private pilot's license and am looking to get my instrument rating.
              I have explored the world of fish with scuba diving, now it is time to explore the world
              of birds with flying. I remember as a kid reading about the Wright Brothers and their exciting first flight in Kitty
              Hawk, North Carlolina. Since then, I have been fascinated by flying. The physics and engineering that goes into
              flying is fun to learn about and even more fun to apply.</p>

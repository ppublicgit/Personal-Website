              <p>This project is still ongoing. I have shared some of my code to my github (<a href="https://www.github.com/ppublicgit/Finance">finance repository</a>).
                 The code is all first version tests of what I want to implement. Due to the nature of stock trading, I have not shared all my code, ideas or final versions.
                 Only the early versions of my codes and the simple concept ideas, mainly for backtesting purposes.</p>
              <p>One area of interest I have long had is in the stock market. It is an intriguing system
              of human interaction, on a global scale. Many common mathematics and even physics processes
              surprisngly show up in financial markets. One of the most important and famous of these patterns
              is the price of stocks. Louis Bachelier, a french mathematician, is credited with the discovery of the
              brownian motion of stock prices in his Ph.D. dissertation, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Bachelier">"The Theory of Speculation"</a>.
              The book by Burton Malkiel, "A Random Walk Down Wall Street", brought this revelation and theory to the public audience. Nowadays,
              with the advent of faster and faster computers and simple, easy to use programming languages, the popularity of quantitative trading has taken off.
              Things such as high-frequency trading and statistical arbitrage have become common practices for hedge funds and day traders. Furthermore, large data
              facilitates traders in formulating trading ideas and backtesting their performance against historical data.</p>
              <p>I decided I would dip my feet into the quantitative trading world in order to learn more about the subject and to
              practice my python and math skills. I read several books, including my favorite, by E.P. Chan, "Algorithmic Trading", to learn more on the
              topic and improve my understanding of the field. Following his guide in his book as well as posts on various blogs and forums, I created my own
              tools to help me in trading and finding edges in the market. Among these tools, I have a webscraper for yahoo finance key statistics, twitter and
              stocktwit that collects data via an input of stock symbol and returns a pandas dataframe of important information. I also have various tests for
              cointegration (hurst exponent, ADF, johansen and Variance Ratio) and an asset allocation optimizer (kelly formula) given stock symbols as well. </p>

              Blackjack Card Counting Simulation
            </a>

              <p>Another topic that has long intrigued me is blackjack and card counting.
              I always found the notion of beating the house and winning millions in a single night
              exciting as a kid. However, I always wondered how feasible this scheme actually was. Luckily,
              programming allows us to simulate and solve this question once and for all.</p>
              <p>I had never used python's class structure before and thought this would be a great way to get
              practice with object orientated programming (oop). The code I created is a little rough, as it was my first
              ever attempt at oop in pytohn, but while it is not pretty, it gets the job done. I developed python code to
              simulate many hands of blackjack to see if counting cards was really an effective and reliable means of making money.
              I used oop to create classes for cards, hands, decks and a game of blackjack as well. The user can call on the blackjack
              class and set the rules for the game. This includes if dealer hits on soft 17, how many decks the dealer uses, blackjack
              payout rate and more. The code then uses the strategy tables that fit with the rules chosen by the user, and simulates whatever
              number of hands the user specifies. The code and some simple statistical analysis of a few simulations can be found on my
              github (<a href="https://www.github.com/ppublicgit/Card-Games">Blackjack Simulation Repository</a>)</p>
              <p>What I found was that the margins for error in card counting are incredibly slim. First off, the blackjack payout has to be strong,
              too small and the house always can expect to win. Another key rule is how deep is the penetration point into the deck (this is the point
              at which the dealer reshuffles all the cards, which resets the count). For the card counter to expect to win money, he/she needs a large
              amount of capital (as a serious drawdown period must be survivable, as well as enough money to place large bets when the count is in the
              players favor) and must never make a mistake on strategy or the count. However, to make matters even worse, most casinos these days have
              an eye in the sky watching all players. These eyes in the sky will typically watch players who are doing too well and have someone counting
              cards in the back to check and see if the player is always betting according to the count. This means, to hide that one is counting cards,
              one must occasionally bet against the count to appear as if one is not actually counting. This makes the prospects of winning money via
              card counting individually nigh on impossible. Even if one plays perfect, the winnings are still quite slim. The best method, and in my
              humble opinion the only real method, to winning lots of money counting cards requires a team of counters. The team could have several people
              sit at tables and bet small the whole time to get a count of the table, and then signal to a teammate to come into the table whenever the count
              is strongly in the player's favor. That way, the player can bet big and often early, without having to absorb the losses while trying to establish
              and time the count. This brings in more risk of being caught though, and the winnings are split among a larger group. In the end, there are probably
              easier means to obtain financial wealth than the high risk environment of card counting and casino blackjack.

                <p>I completed several of the common beginner machine learning problems and uploaded the results to my
                github (<a href="https://www.github.com/ppublicgit/machinelearning">Machine Learning Repository</a>).
                These problems included the Iris dataset, boston housing dataset and a height/weight predictor. The
                results and code are displayed using jupyter notebooks. The problems were good practice for me in implementing
                some of the common techniques I had learned through various online courses I had completed and through technical literature.
                The main packages used were pandas and scikit-learn. I demonstrated the effectiveness of several machine learning techniques,
                such as lasso and ridge regression and random forests, and I compared and contrasted their performances.</p>

      <h3>Sandia National Laboratories (SNL)</h3>
      <div class="container">
        <p>I had two major stints at Sandia National Laboratories. I was originally an intern,
        following completion of my Bachelor's Degree in Physics from ASU. I then returned as
        a private contractor to continue my work and research after an extended trip abroad. As an
        intern, I was tasked with creating a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in MATLAB for
        test equipment and collecting data. I spent several months designing the GUI and setting up the
        various protocols used for communicating with all the instruments in the lab. The goal of the project
        was to create a solenoid pressure system to simulate an engine's cycle to extend and further the research
        being done in the lab into nozzle spray characteristics. By the end of the internship I had completed a
        a working GUI that had full, automated control with all the experiment's instruments as well as an initial
        visualization of each run's data and saving said data. The instrument communication was built primarily on
        object-oriented-programming, allowing future users an easy means for updating and upgrading the communications.
        A link to a pdf for the research paper and poster for the internship are provided below.</p>
        <p>When I returned to Sandia as a private contractor, I was tasked with creating a GUI in LabVIEW for a different
        experiment, as well as updating the MATLAB GUI I had previously designed. I added several new features to the MATLAB
        GUI to improve its efficiency and user satisfaction. I also spent some time training some of my coworkers how to code
        in MATLAB as well as in GUI control and maintenance. The LabVIEW GUI was trickier than the MATLAB GUI as it had multiple
        data collection speeds, times of interest and required precise timing and synchronization between high and low speed data
        acquisition units. Eventually, I was able to implement an advanced system with precise digital triggering timing to
        synchronize all data acquistion. I also trained fellow lab workers in LabVIEW to facilitate ease of use and understanding for
        the GUI</p>
        <p>Lastly, I collected data using my MATLAB GUI in various different pressure system environments to research the affects of
          a variable pressure on nozzle spray characteristics. Data was collected for the pressure of the system, as well as high-speed
          imaging of the bubble characteristics inside an injector nozzle in order to investigate performance. I generated code in MATLAB
          to perform high-speed image processing and recognition to determine how the bubbles in the nozzle were affected by the pressure
          cycling in the system. I then visualized the data in MATLAB and authored a paper on the topic with the assistance of my principal
          investigator/supervisor and colleagues. The paper is currently pending publication.

      <h3>Arizona State University (ASU)</h3>
      <div class="container">
        <p>During my junior and senior years at Arizona State University, I worked as an undergraduate
        research assistant in an astrophysics lab. The position doubled as a job and as a class for me as it
        allowed me to complete my honor's thesis (required for graduation for Barrett the Honor's College).
        I worked on the design, construction and testing of a low temperature (~2.5K) cryostat. It was similar to the
        work I completed at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, but this time I was able to test and characterize the noise
        of microwave kinetic inductance inductors(MKIDs). My honor's thesis focused on the analysis of the MKIDs noise
        data. I used python to automate the data collection from the MKIDs. The MKIDs were brought down to a temperature of
        2.9K and then a vector network analyzer (VNA) was used to send signals to the MKIDs and to record their responses.
        Optical fiber was ran from the VNA outside the vessel to the MKID inside to limit thermal heating from conduction, as
        copper wiring would have heated the MKIDs to much higher than 2.9K. The collected data was analzed in python using various
        mathematics and physics techniques and equations to characterize the noise of the MKIDs. The results of the research and
        the thesis can be viewed in the link's below.</p>

      <h3>Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL)</h3>
      <div class="container">
        <p>As a junior in college I spent my summer as a research intern at LBNL.
          My work at LBNL focused on the design and construction of a cryostat (low temperature, low pressure vessel
          used to test superconducting detectors). In particular, I was tasked with designing and constructing the milliKelvin stage,
          to be used a as a testbed for research and development of detectors to be used to observe microwave radiation from space. My work
          mainly consisted of three different areas while at LBNL. The first was CAD modeling. I used SolidWorks and other tools to design
          various parts for the system as well as to create the engineering drawings we sent to machinists to create said parts. I also was a part
          of the review process for quality control of incoming and outgoing drawings and parts. Phase two of my research was constructing the apparatus itself.
          This consisted of installing the parts upon arrival and researching proper material and equipment needed for experimental setup and data collection.
          The last portion of the research was testing the vessel. Not all the parts were able to be added by the time I left due to long lead times on the
          delivery of some parts, but I was able to successfully test the performance of what had arrived. I created code in python to communicate with
          an assortment of sensors and detectors to automate the data collection and subsequently used code in python to analyze the outputs. The vessel passed
          all of its tests.<p>

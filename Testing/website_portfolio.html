      <h3>Sandia National Laboratories (SNL)</h3>
      <div class="container">
        <p>I had two major stints at Sandia National Laboratories. I was originally an intern,
        following completion of my Bachelor's Degree in Physics from ASU. I then returned as
        a private contractor to continue my work and research after an extended trip abroad. As an
        intern, I was tasked with creating a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in MATLAB for
        test equipment and collecting data. I spent several months designing the GUI and setting up the
        various protocols used for communicating with all the instruments in the lab. The goal of the project
        was to create a solenoid pressure system to simulate an engine's cycle to extend and further the research
        being done in the lab into nozzle spray characteristics. By the end of the internship I had completed a
        a working GUI that had full, automated control with all the experiment's instruments as well as an initial
        visualization of each run's data and saving said data. The instrument communication was built primarily on
        object-oriented-programming, allowing future users an easy means for updating and upgrading the communications.
        A link to a pdf for the research paper and poster for the internship are provided below.</p>
        <p>When I returned to Sandia as a private contractor, I was tasked with creating a GUI in LabVIEW for a different
        experiment, as well as updating the MATLAB GUI I had previously designed. I added several new features to the MATLAB
        GUI to improve its efficiency and user satisfaction. I also spent some time training some of my coworkers how to code
        in MATLAB as well as in GUI control and maintenance. The LabVIEW GUI was trickier than the MATLAB GUI as it had multiple
        data collection speeds, times of interest and required precise timing and synchronization between high and low speed data
        acquisition units. Eventually, I was able to implement an advanced system with precise digital triggering timing to
        synchronize all data acquistion. I also trained fellow lab workers in LabVIEW to facilitate ease of use and understanding for
        the GUI</p>
        <p>Lastly, I collected data using my MATLAB GUI in various different pressure system environments to research the affects of
          a variable pressure on nozzle spray characteristics. Data was collected for the pressure of the system, as well as high-speed
          imaging of the bubble characteristics inside an injector nozzle in order to investigate performance. I generated code in MATLAB
          to perform high-speed image processing and recognition to determine how the bubbles in the nozzle were affected by the pressure
          cycling in the system. I then visualized the data in MATLAB and authored a paper on the topic with the assistance of my principal
          investigator/supervisor and colleagues. The paper is currently pending publication.

      <h3>Arizona State University (ASU)</h3>
      <div class="container">
        <p>During my junior and senior years at Arizona State University, I worked as an undergraduate
        research assistant in an astrophysics lab. The position doubled as a job and as a class for me as it
        allowed me to complete my honor's thesis (required for graduation for Barrett the Honor's College).
        I worked on the design, construction and testing of a low temperature (~2.5K) cryostat. It was similar to the
        work I completed at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, but this time I was able to test and characterize the noise
        of microwave kinetic inductance inductors(MKIDs). My honor's thesis focused on the analysis of the MKIDs noise
        data. I used python to automate the data collection from the MKIDs. The MKIDs were brought down to a temperature of
        2.9K and then a vector network analyzer (VNA) was used to send signals to the MKIDs and to record their responses.
        Optical fiber was ran from the VNA outside the vessel to the MKID inside to limit thermal heating from conduction, as
        copper wiring would have heated the MKIDs to much higher than 2.9K. The collected data was analzed in python using various
        mathematics and physics techniques and equations to characterize the noise of the MKIDs. The results of the research and
        the thesis can be viewed in the link's below.</p>

      <h3>Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL)</h3>
      <div class="container">
        <p>As a junior in college I spent my summer as a research intern at LBNL.
          My work at LBNL focused on the design and construction of a cryostat (low temperature, low pressure vessel
          used to test superconducting detectors). In particular, I was tasked with designing and constructing the milliKelvin stage,
          to be used a as a testbed for research and development of detectors to be used to observe microwave radiation from space. My work
          mainly consisted of three different areas while at LBNL. The first was CAD modeling. I used SolidWorks and other tools to design
          various parts for the system as well as to create the engineering drawings we sent to machinists to create said parts. I also was a part
          of the review process for quality control of incoming and outgoing drawings and parts. Phase two of my research was constructing the apparatus itself.
          This consisted of installing the parts upon arrival and researching proper material and equipment needed for experimental setup and data collection.
          The last portion of the research was testing the vessel. Not all the parts were able to be added by the time I left due to long lead times on the
          delivery of some parts, but I was able to successfully test the performance of what had arrived. I created code in python to communicate with
          an assortment of sensors and detectors to automate the data collection and subsequently used code in python to analyze the outputs. The vessel passed
          all of its tests.<p>
